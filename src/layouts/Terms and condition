        <li>
          <strong>Charges and Deductions:</strong> Following the initial meeting
          and prior to sharing the complete planning details, charges for

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Payment Terms:</strong> A 90% advance payment is required
          before the event. The remaining 10% of the event package must be
          settled either a day prior to or on the day of the event, after the
          initial setup. Payments are accepted only via cash, GPay, or PhonePe.
          We do not accept cheques, credit cards, or NEFT for the final payment.
          Late payments will not be accommodated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Event Lighting:</strong> The lighting for the second event

          <strong>Budget Setting:</strong> The budget for the event will be
          established following consultation with the client.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional Charges:</strong> Any additions or modifications
          beyond the initial agreement will incur additional charges based on
          the costs involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cooperation Requirement:</strong> The client agrees to fully
          cooperate with the Wedding Planner and be available for all necessary
          decision-making related to the planning of the event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cancellation Policy:</strong> In the event of cancellation
          after the confirmation, a cancellation charge of 20% of the quoted
          amount will be applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advance Payment Cancellation:</strong> If the event is
          canceled after the advance payment has been made, a fee of 25% of the
          paid amount will be retained by the company.
